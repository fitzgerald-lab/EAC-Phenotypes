This repository contains the data files and analysis code used in **"Integrated epidemiological and molecular data yields insights into the relationship between precancerous Barrettâ€™s and oesophageal adenocarcinoma"** published in [journal name] on [date]. 

The files are organized into three main folders:


- data: Contains de-identified example input data.
- scripts: contains analysis code to reproduce the analysis.
- results: filtered results generated from the soruce files.

**For genomic analysis**
A complete list of software and algorithms used is provided in scripts/genomic_analysis/Software_algorithms_list.pdf. 

All relevant tools are open-access. We include the core code and data specific to our study to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
